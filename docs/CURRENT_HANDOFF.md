# Current ERN handoff

Use `docs/ERN_SOFT_LAUNCH_STAGE1_HANDOFF_2026-10-02.md` as the canonical Soft Launch continuity point and `docs/AFFILIATE_COVERAGE_EXPANSION_2026-10-02.md` as the current commercial coverage audit.

Current operating state:
- **ERN Soft Launch / Operating Stage 1**
- **OPERATE · VERIFY · MAINTAIN · FOCUSED EXPANSION AUTHORIZED**
- AI Search Discovery Readiness is complete and production-validated.
- Minimal first-party aggregate analytics and search-gap logging are active.
- Affiliate Coverage Expansion Batch A is complete: Kyoto/Klook, Seoul/Klook, Rome/Tiqets and Rovaniemi/Klook exact destination links are human-verified and recorded.
- Commercial ranking remains independent of commission/payout.
- Existing public feature gates remain unchanged.

Preserve completed Phases 6–10, current GitHub `main`, deployed production work, affiliate/SEO/analytics work, and all existing feature gates.

Commercial payout state:
- Travelpayouts payout method was configured and email-confirmed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- Viator payout setup was confirmed completed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- No current payout-setup blocker remains for the active ERN affiliate relationships.

Next commercial work should be demand-led from real analytics rather than offer-count expansion. Accommodation/stay remains the largest partner-category gap, but no new account or terms should be accepted without explicit owner approval.

Older dated handoffs remain historical context only.


Production incident — 2026-10-02:
- Owner browser testing exposed Watch Earth at 0 current windows and widespread RECHECK DUE states.
- Root cause: public currentness horizons were too short for real operation (24h embeds / 72h external-live) while Operations only reported rechecks and did not mutate source evidence.
- Repaired policy: embed 168h, external-live 168h, live-image 72h, general external page 336h; embed playback proof aligned to 168h.
- Watch Earth release audit now includes the actual current clock, not only historical anchor timestamps, preventing silent deploys with zero current windows.
- A stale commercial preflight that still required Travelpayouts payout readiness to be false was also corrected after owner payout setup.
- Current-clock Operations validation after repair reported 11 Watch Earth windows, 11 places, 6 countries and 6 providers.
- Pages run 37025041354 completed SUCCESS and deployed the repair.


First-impression / discovery breadth tranche — 2026-10-02:
- Watch Earth no longer artificially caps external-current views at 12 when inside-ERN embeds are below the preferred count; it can now fill the truthful 20-window target while still preferring inside playback.
- Explore now surfaces 30 places on the initial no-query view instead of 12 and reports the broader discoverable/current place count.
- Actual-clock Watch Earth release audit now fails if production falls below 8 current windows.
- A separate ERN Live Health Watch is active and will only alert on severe current-window collapse or broken core live/search/map functionality.
- Performance ceiling remained enforced; the broader-discovery change was trimmed to stay under the app-size budget.
- Pages deployment for the broadened discovery build completed successfully.

Affiliate Expansion Batch B:
- Prepared across all four approved relationships.
- Klook: Bangkok, Singapore.
- Tiqets: Chicago, London.
- Viator: Dublin, Cape Town.
- Welcome Pickups: Bangkok, Rome.
- Exact tracked links are still owner-side evidence; no fabricated or automatic partner links are allowed.
- See `docs/AFFILIATE_EXPANSION_BATCH_B_2026-10-02.md`.


Focused expansion authorization — 2026-10-03:
- Owner explicitly asked ERN to continue on two parallel lanes: (1) featured cameras + more healthy searchable places, and (2) business-side expansion.
- Current healthy searchable destination baseline after Vienna/Helsinki/Koli/Turku promotion: 91 distinct places from 98 source records.
- Content goal: grow carefully toward roughly 150–200 genuinely useful searchable destinations; candidates remain research-only until source-specific live/playback verification.
- Current next source-verification pool includes Prague tower cameras, additional Finland/Switzerland candidates, Salzburg, and official Madeira Tourism webcams.
- Business expansion should still prefer the four already-active relationships before opening new partner accounts.
- New York legacy affiliate place IDs were repaired to the canonical new-york-harbor place so existing verified Klook/Tiqets links can become useful again without new owner setup.
- New commercial opportunities queued without public activation: Vienna/Tiqets, Helsinki/Viator, Turku/Viator.
- No paid ranking, automatic placement, automatic link rewriting, or unverified affiliate link publication is permitted.


Large focused expansion batch — 2026-10-03:
- Visitor lane remains at 91 healthy searchable places while the private research queue expands toward 150–200 genuinely useful destinations.
- Prague exact camera targets are isolated; Salzburg, Innsbruck, Dubrovnik, Malta and Tallinn are reduced to one-click owner verification paths.
- Official Innsbruck Tourism family expanded in research with distinct Patscherkofel, Mieminger Plateau, Telfs, Kühtai, Lüsens, Nordkette, Stadtturm and Swarovski Kristallwelten/Wattens candidates. None are public/current until human playback verification.
- Business opportunity queue expanded with Zermatt/Viator, San Diego Zoo/Viator and Whistler/Viator research in addition to Vienna, Helsinki, Lucerne, Tbilisi, Cancún, Yellowstone, Georgia Aquarium and San Diego Zoo/Tiqets.
- Prague/Tiqets and Salzburg/Tiqets are explicitly gated behind successful source promotion first.
- Accommodation partner research remains fail-closed for Hotels.com and Trip.com until ERN-owner Travelpayouts availability is checked.
- A consolidated machine-readable operating plan now lives at data/focused-expansion-plan.json.
- All existing public gates and commercial-neutral ranking safeguards remain unchanged.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:20 UTC:
- Performance/release issue resolved without weakening the strict size budget; Pages subsequently achieved a successful deployment with syntax/Operations safeguards intact.
- Healthy searchable baseline remains 91 distinct places; source research queue expanded to 41 total candidates (4 promoted, 37 playback-gated).
- Innsbruck official source family expanded with eight distinct city/mountain/village/attraction candidates; no candidate was promoted automatically.
- Source verification is now prioritized in data/source-verification-priority.json.
- Business opportunity registry expanded with Tallinn/Tiqets, Malta/Tiqets, Dubrovnik/Viator, Zermatt/Viator, San Diego/Viator and Whistler/Viator research paths.
- Commercial expansion is now additionally prioritized across uncovered healthy places in data/commercial-priority-matrix.json.
- Existing four partners remain the preferred expansion path; accommodation candidates remain research-only; all public ranking/commercial safeguards remain unchanged.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:20 UTC:
- Current healthy/searchable baseline remains 91 places; private playback-gated expansion queue is now 49 candidates.
- Added official Taiwan Tourism Administration Live Taiwan research family (8 distinct places) and additional SANParks research family (Satara, Olifants, Punda Maria, Talamati) without auto-promoting any source.
- Added data/featured-camera-rotation.json: 24-place editorial audit spanning 18 countries and 21 providers, advisory only and commercial-neutral.
- Added/updated geographic gap planning so Europe/North America growth is controlled while South America, broader Africa, wider Asia, Oceania and Caribbean are prioritized.
- Commercial opportunity registry now has 12 verified-link, 16 exact-link-required and 10 source-gated opportunities.
- Added Aruba, Kīlauea and Torres del Paine Viator opportunities plus Taiwan/Klook, Hualien/Viator and Kruger/Viator source-gated paths.
- Healthy places with verified offers remain 19; 16 additional healthy places now have an explicit commercial queue, reducing the unqueued healthy-commercial gap to 57.
- Owner actions remain batched and dormant until truly needed; no automatic placement, rewriting, paid ranking or unverified promotion.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:32 UTC:
- Public healthy/searchable baseline remains 91; private playback-gated source queue expanded to 51 candidates without weakening truth/currentness rules.
- Added official Taiwan Tourism Administration family (8), additional SANParks family (4), Mendoza municipal live-camera candidate, and conservative Ushuaia municipal harbour candidate.
- Featured editorial audit remains geographically broad: 24 places / 18 countries / 21 providers, advisory and commercial-neutral.
- Geography-gap plan now suppresses Europe/North America overexpansion and prioritizes underrepresented South America, broader Africa, wider Asia, Oceania and Caribbean.
- Commercial opportunity states: 12 verified-link, 16 exact-link-required, 11 source-gated.
- Verified offers cover 19 healthy places; 16 more healthy places have explicit commercial queues; 57 remain deliberately unqueued pending stronger evidence.
- Added Aruba, Kīlauea and Torres del Paine Viator exact-link opportunities; added Taiwan/Klook, Hualien/Viator, Kruger/Viator and Ushuaia/Viator source-gated paths.
- Owner work remains bundled in one dormant packet; no new affiliate program activation, automatic placement, rewriting, paid ranking or unverified source promotion occurred.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:46 UTC:
- Public healthy/searchable baseline remains deliberately unchanged at 91 distinct places; no research-only camera was promoted automatically.
- Private source research registry now contains 61 candidates: 4 promoted, 57 human-playback-gated.
- New underrepresented-region families: Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority (Grand Baie, Pointe d’Esny, Saint-Félix) and official Visit St. Maarten-endorsed cameras (Maho Beach, Great Bay/Philipsburg Boardwalk, Simpson Bay).
- Geography-gap accounting was rebuilt from the real candidate registry so South America, Africa, Asia and Caribbean backlog counts no longer disappear from planning.
- Commercial registry now contains 42 opportunities: 12 verified-link, 18 exact-link-required, 12 source-gated.
- New business paths: Mauritius/Klook after camera verification, Boulders Beach/Viator exact-link research, and St. Maarten/Viator exact-link research using the already-healthy Little Bay place.
- Source verification priority, commercial priority matrix, focused expansion plan and dormant owner packet were all refreshed together to avoid duplicate future research.
- Existing four affiliate relationships remain the preferred path; new partner activation, paid ranking, automatic placement/rewriting and unverified source promotion remain prohibited.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:55 UTC:
- Healthy/searchable production baseline remains 91; no research-only source was promoted automatically.
- Private source research registry now contains 67 candidates: 4 promoted and 63 human-playback-gated.
- Added new underrepresented-region families from official tourism sources: Mauritius (Grand Baie, Pointe d’Esny, Saint-Félix), St. Maarten (Maho Beach, Great Bay/Philipsburg Boardwalk, Simpson Bay), Wānaka (4 views) and Rotorua (2 views).
- Commercial opportunity registry now contains 44 entries: 12 verified-link, 18 exact-link-required and 14 source-gated.
- New business paths include Mauritius/Klook, St. Maarten/Viator, Wānaka/Klook and Rotorua/Viator; all source-gated where appropriate.
- Boulders Beach/Viator is queued as an exact-link opportunity from an already-healthy ERN place.
- Geography gaps, verification priority, commercial matrix, focused plan and dormant owner batch were refreshed after each expansion family.
- Public ranking remains commercial-neutral; no automatic placement, rewriting, new partner activation or unverified source promotion occurred.


Pamir Mountains gap — 2026-10-03:
- ERN currently has no Pamir Mountains / Tajikistan live camera in the active source registry or research candidates.
- Public-web research found official Tajikistan/Pamir destination material and current commercial Pamir Highway inventory, but no trustworthy source-specific always-current live camera suitable for promotion.
- Pamir is now tracked as a P1 source gap in data/source-gap-watchlist.json, targeting Khorog, Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley and the Pamir Highway.
- A future Viator Pamir opportunity is recorded, but it is explicitly blocked until ERN first obtains and verifies a genuine Pamir current/live source.


Central Asia expansion lane — 2026-10-03:
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains a P1 unresolved live-source gap; no trustworthy scenic live camera was found yet for Khorog, Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley or the Pamir Highway.
- Adjacent high-value live-camera research was added for Shymbulak Mountain Resort (Kazakhstan), Karakol Ski Base, Ala-Archa Natural Park and Osh/Sulaiman-Too (Kyrgyzstan).
- Shymbulak and Karakol have official resort camera pages; KG Camera explicitly publishes live/no-archive cameras for Ala-Archa and Osh with a short delay.
- These adjacent cameras improve Central Asia representation but do not count as solving the Pamir gap.
- Viator/Shymbulak and Viator/Karakol future opportunities are source-gated; Pamir/Viator remains blocked until a genuine Pamir live source exists.


Central Asia large-batch checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:35 UTC:
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains an explicitly unresolved P1 source gap. Fresh English/Russian web research still found no trustworthy scenic current camera for Murghab, Khorog, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley or the Pamir Highway; Windfinder currently reports no nearby Murghab webcams.
- No prerecorded Pamir travel video, weather iframe or generic directory was promoted as LIVE.
- Kyrgyzstan adjacent coverage was deepened with direct, source-specific KG Camera targets for Karakol Ski Base, Ala-Archa Natural Park, Osh/Sulaiman-Too, Naryn central square, Too-Ashu Pass north entrance, Suusamyr Valley, Balykchy, Issyk-Kul/KarVen Four Seasons and Bishkek/Ala-Too Square.
- KG Camera states its feeds are unarchived surveillance with about a 20-second delay; every candidate still requires owner playback confirmation before ERN promotion.
- Viator source-gated opportunities were added for Ala-Archa/Bishkek and Issyk-Kul, based on current Viator inventory. Commercial links remain blocked until the corresponding camera/source is promoted.
- Central Asia adjacent cameras improve regional breadth but do not count as solving the Pamir/Tajikistan gap.
- Focused expansion counts and source-verification priorities were reconciled after the batch.


Mountain expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:45 UTC:
- Pamir research was broadened across Tajik core, Wakhan/Murghab/Karakul, Kyrgyz Alay/Osh/Batken and eastern approaches. No trustworthy core-Pamir live camera was confirmed; ERN preserves this as an explicit research gap instead of substituting prerecorded travel video.
- Added playback-gated Central Asia gateway candidates: Osh Sulaiman-Too, Batken panorama and Ala-Archa National Park.
- Added playback-gated mountain candidates outside the Pamir where live evidence is stronger: Gudauri, Kobi, Shymbulak, Everest/Hotel Everest View and Khumbu Glacier scientific camera.
- New source-gated business paths prepared: Klook Pamir Highway, Klook Ala-Archa, Klook Gudauri, Klook Shymbulak and Viator Everest/Khumbu.
- Source verification priorities and the focused expansion plan were refreshed so owner checks remain small, one-click where possible, and commercially useful only after truth verification.


Pamir / Kyrgyz approach research — 2026-10-03:
- Core Pamir remains intentionally unresolved: no trustworthy live feed found for Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan, Ak-Baital or comparable core Tajik Pamir locations.
- ERN will not substitute prerecorded travel videos, GNSS monitoring stations or static tourism media for live Earth truth.
- Added research-only Kyrgyz mountain/approach candidates from kg.camera: Osh/Sulayman-Too, Batken, Razzakov, Suusamyr Valley, Ala-Archa and Karakol Ski Base.
- These broaden Central Asia coverage without falsely labeling them as Pamir proper.


Central Europe / Aegean expansion batch — 2026-10-03:
- Added research-only live candidates for Lake Bled (Slovenia), Mykonos New Port (Greece), Santorini caldera/Imerovigli (Greece), and Poiana Brașov (Romania).
- Bled and Mykonos use official tourism/municipal live pages; Poiana Brașov uses destination tourism webcam pages; Santorini uses a strong long-running provider live stream and remains link-only unless rights are explicitly established.
- Added source-gated Viator business opportunities for Bled, Mykonos, Santorini and Brașov; none can activate before the corresponding live source is human-confirmed and promoted.
- Pamir core remains intentionally unresolved; six Kyrgyz approach/mountain candidates are research-only and do not masquerade as Pamir proper.
- Source verification priority and focused expansion plan were refreshed after this batch.


Scenic-place commercial expansion — 2026-10-03:
- Added exact-link research paths for Flåm/Aurlandsfjord, Addo Elephant National Park, Chamonix/Mont Blanc, Bergen and Pico Island using the already-active Viator relationship.
- Each remains account-search / exact-link gated; no URL is invented and no public placement occurs until owner-generated tracked-link verification.
- Commercial priority matrix was refreshed so newly queued places stop appearing as generic uncovered research.


Istanbul / Bali world-gap batch — 2026-10-03:
- Added official Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality touristic-camera candidates for Sultanahmet and a Bosphorus-side view family.
- Added official Denpasar City ATCS real-time CCTV as a Bali urban live-source candidate; only a visually useful camera should be promoted.
- Added source-gated Klook + Viator business paths for Istanbul and Klook/Viator paths for Bali/Denpasar, with duplicate commercial density explicitly discouraged.
- Source verification priority and focused expansion plan refreshed.
