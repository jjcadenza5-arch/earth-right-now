# Current ERN handoff

Use `docs/ERN_SOFT_LAUNCH_STAGE1_HANDOFF_2026-10-02.md` as the canonical Soft Launch continuity point and `docs/AFFILIATE_COVERAGE_EXPANSION_2026-10-02.md` as the current commercial coverage audit.

Current operating state:
- **ERN Soft Launch / Operating Stage 1**
- **OPERATE · VERIFY · MAINTAIN · FOCUSED EXPANSION AUTHORIZED**
- AI Search Discovery Readiness is complete and production-validated.
- Minimal first-party aggregate analytics and search-gap logging are active.
- Affiliate Coverage Expansion Batch A is complete: Kyoto/Klook, Seoul/Klook, Rome/Tiqets and Rovaniemi/Klook exact destination links are human-verified and recorded.
- Commercial ranking remains independent of commission/payout.
- Existing public feature gates remain unchanged.

Preserve completed Phases 6–10, current GitHub `main`, deployed production work, affiliate/SEO/analytics work, and all existing feature gates.

Commercial payout state:
- Travelpayouts payout method was configured and email-confirmed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- Viator payout setup was confirmed completed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- No current payout-setup blocker remains for the active ERN affiliate relationships.

Next commercial work should be demand-led from real analytics rather than offer-count expansion. Accommodation/stay remains the largest partner-category gap, but no new account or terms should be accepted without explicit owner approval.

Older dated handoffs remain historical context only.


Production incident — 2026-10-02:
- Owner browser testing exposed Watch Earth at 0 current windows and widespread RECHECK DUE states.
- Root cause: public currentness horizons were too short for real operation (24h embeds / 72h external-live) while Operations only reported rechecks and did not mutate source evidence.
- Repaired policy: embed 168h, external-live 168h, live-image 72h, general external page 336h; embed playback proof aligned to 168h.
- Watch Earth release audit now includes the actual current clock, not only historical anchor timestamps, preventing silent deploys with zero current windows.
- A stale commercial preflight that still required Travelpayouts payout readiness to be false was also corrected after owner payout setup.
- Current-clock Operations validation after repair reported 11 Watch Earth windows, 11 places, 6 countries and 6 providers.
- Pages run 37025041354 completed SUCCESS and deployed the repair.


First-impression / discovery breadth tranche — 2026-10-02:
- Watch Earth no longer artificially caps external-current views at 12 when inside-ERN embeds are below the preferred count; it can now fill the truthful 20-window target while still preferring inside playback.
- Explore now surfaces 30 places on the initial no-query view instead of 12 and reports the broader discoverable/current place count.
- Actual-clock Watch Earth release audit now fails if production falls below 8 current windows.
- A separate ERN Live Health Watch is active and will only alert on severe current-window collapse or broken core live/search/map functionality.
- Performance ceiling remained enforced; the broader-discovery change was trimmed to stay under the app-size budget.
- Pages deployment for the broadened discovery build completed successfully.

Affiliate Expansion Batch B:
- Prepared across all four approved relationships.
- Klook: Bangkok, Singapore.
- Tiqets: Chicago, London.
- Viator: Dublin, Cape Town.
- Welcome Pickups: Bangkok, Rome.
- Exact tracked links are still owner-side evidence; no fabricated or automatic partner links are allowed.
- See `docs/AFFILIATE_EXPANSION_BATCH_B_2026-10-02.md`.


Focused expansion authorization — 2026-10-03:
- Owner explicitly asked ERN to continue on two parallel lanes: (1) featured cameras + more healthy searchable places, and (2) business-side expansion.
- Current healthy searchable destination baseline after Vienna/Helsinki/Koli/Turku promotion: 91 distinct places from 98 source records.
- Content goal: grow carefully toward roughly 150–200 genuinely useful searchable destinations; candidates remain research-only until source-specific live/playback verification.
- Current next source-verification pool includes Prague tower cameras, additional Finland/Switzerland candidates, Salzburg, and official Madeira Tourism webcams.
- Business expansion should still prefer the four already-active relationships before opening new partner accounts.
- New York legacy affiliate place IDs were repaired to the canonical new-york-harbor place so existing verified Klook/Tiqets links can become useful again without new owner setup.
- New commercial opportunities queued without public activation: Vienna/Tiqets, Helsinki/Viator, Turku/Viator.
- No paid ranking, automatic placement, automatic link rewriting, or unverified affiliate link publication is permitted.


Large focused expansion batch — 2026-10-03:
- Visitor lane remains at 91 healthy searchable places while the private research queue expands toward 150–200 genuinely useful destinations.
- Prague exact camera targets are isolated; Salzburg, Innsbruck, Dubrovnik, Malta and Tallinn are reduced to one-click owner verification paths.
- Official Innsbruck Tourism family expanded in research with distinct Patscherkofel, Mieminger Plateau, Telfs, Kühtai, Lüsens, Nordkette, Stadtturm and Swarovski Kristallwelten/Wattens candidates. None are public/current until human playback verification.
- Business opportunity queue expanded with Zermatt/Viator, San Diego Zoo/Viator and Whistler/Viator research in addition to Vienna, Helsinki, Lucerne, Tbilisi, Cancún, Yellowstone, Georgia Aquarium and San Diego Zoo/Tiqets.
- Prague/Tiqets and Salzburg/Tiqets are explicitly gated behind successful source promotion first.
- Accommodation partner research remains fail-closed for Hotels.com and Trip.com until ERN-owner Travelpayouts availability is checked.
- A consolidated machine-readable operating plan now lives at data/focused-expansion-plan.json.
- All existing public gates and commercial-neutral ranking safeguards remain unchanged.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:20 UTC:
- Performance/release issue resolved without weakening the strict size budget; Pages subsequently achieved a successful deployment with syntax/Operations safeguards intact.
- Healthy searchable baseline remains 91 distinct places; source research queue expanded to 41 total candidates (4 promoted, 37 playback-gated).
- Innsbruck official source family expanded with eight distinct city/mountain/village/attraction candidates; no candidate was promoted automatically.
- Source verification is now prioritized in data/source-verification-priority.json.
- Business opportunity registry expanded with Tallinn/Tiqets, Malta/Tiqets, Dubrovnik/Viator, Zermatt/Viator, San Diego/Viator and Whistler/Viator research paths.
- Commercial expansion is now additionally prioritized across uncovered healthy places in data/commercial-priority-matrix.json.
- Existing four partners remain the preferred expansion path; accommodation candidates remain research-only; all public ranking/commercial safeguards remain unchanged.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:20 UTC:
- Current healthy/searchable baseline remains 91 places; private playback-gated expansion queue is now 49 candidates.
- Added official Taiwan Tourism Administration Live Taiwan research family (8 distinct places) and additional SANParks research family (Satara, Olifants, Punda Maria, Talamati) without auto-promoting any source.
- Added data/featured-camera-rotation.json: 24-place editorial audit spanning 18 countries and 21 providers, advisory only and commercial-neutral.
- Added/updated geographic gap planning so Europe/North America growth is controlled while South America, broader Africa, wider Asia, Oceania and Caribbean are prioritized.
- Commercial opportunity registry now has 12 verified-link, 16 exact-link-required and 10 source-gated opportunities.
- Added Aruba, Kīlauea and Torres del Paine Viator opportunities plus Taiwan/Klook, Hualien/Viator and Kruger/Viator source-gated paths.
- Healthy places with verified offers remain 19; 16 additional healthy places now have an explicit commercial queue, reducing the unqueued healthy-commercial gap to 57.
- Owner actions remain batched and dormant until truly needed; no automatic placement, rewriting, paid ranking or unverified promotion.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:32 UTC:
- Public healthy/searchable baseline remains 91; private playback-gated source queue expanded to 51 candidates without weakening truth/currentness rules.
- Added official Taiwan Tourism Administration family (8), additional SANParks family (4), Mendoza municipal live-camera candidate, and conservative Ushuaia municipal harbour candidate.
- Featured editorial audit remains geographically broad: 24 places / 18 countries / 21 providers, advisory and commercial-neutral.
- Geography-gap plan now suppresses Europe/North America overexpansion and prioritizes underrepresented South America, broader Africa, wider Asia, Oceania and Caribbean.
- Commercial opportunity states: 12 verified-link, 16 exact-link-required, 11 source-gated.
- Verified offers cover 19 healthy places; 16 more healthy places have explicit commercial queues; 57 remain deliberately unqueued pending stronger evidence.
- Added Aruba, Kīlauea and Torres del Paine Viator exact-link opportunities; added Taiwan/Klook, Hualien/Viator, Kruger/Viator and Ushuaia/Viator source-gated paths.
- Owner work remains bundled in one dormant packet; no new affiliate program activation, automatic placement, rewriting, paid ranking or unverified source promotion occurred.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:46 UTC:
- Public healthy/searchable baseline remains deliberately unchanged at 91 distinct places; no research-only camera was promoted automatically.
- Private source research registry now contains 61 candidates: 4 promoted, 57 human-playback-gated.
- New underrepresented-region families: Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority (Grand Baie, Pointe d’Esny, Saint-Félix) and official Visit St. Maarten-endorsed cameras (Maho Beach, Great Bay/Philipsburg Boardwalk, Simpson Bay).
- Geography-gap accounting was rebuilt from the real candidate registry so South America, Africa, Asia and Caribbean backlog counts no longer disappear from planning.
- Commercial registry now contains 42 opportunities: 12 verified-link, 18 exact-link-required, 12 source-gated.
- New business paths: Mauritius/Klook after camera verification, Boulders Beach/Viator exact-link research, and St. Maarten/Viator exact-link research using the already-healthy Little Bay place.
- Source verification priority, commercial priority matrix, focused expansion plan and dormant owner packet were all refreshed together to avoid duplicate future research.
- Existing four affiliate relationships remain the preferred path; new partner activation, paid ranking, automatic placement/rewriting and unverified source promotion remain prohibited.


Large-batch expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:55 UTC:
- Healthy/searchable production baseline remains 91; no research-only source was promoted automatically.
- Private source research registry now contains 67 candidates: 4 promoted and 63 human-playback-gated.
- Added new underrepresented-region families from official tourism sources: Mauritius (Grand Baie, Pointe d’Esny, Saint-Félix), St. Maarten (Maho Beach, Great Bay/Philipsburg Boardwalk, Simpson Bay), Wānaka (4 views) and Rotorua (2 views).
- Commercial opportunity registry now contains 44 entries: 12 verified-link, 18 exact-link-required and 14 source-gated.
- New business paths include Mauritius/Klook, St. Maarten/Viator, Wānaka/Klook and Rotorua/Viator; all source-gated where appropriate.
- Boulders Beach/Viator is queued as an exact-link opportunity from an already-healthy ERN place.
- Geography gaps, verification priority, commercial matrix, focused plan and dormant owner batch were refreshed after each expansion family.
- Public ranking remains commercial-neutral; no automatic placement, rewriting, new partner activation or unverified source promotion occurred.


Pamir Mountains gap — 2026-10-03:
- ERN currently has no Pamir Mountains / Tajikistan live camera in the active source registry or research candidates.
- Public-web research found official Tajikistan/Pamir destination material and current commercial Pamir Highway inventory, but no trustworthy source-specific always-current live camera suitable for promotion.
- Pamir is now tracked as a P1 source gap in data/source-gap-watchlist.json, targeting Khorog, Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley and the Pamir Highway.
- A future Viator Pamir opportunity is recorded, but it is explicitly blocked until ERN first obtains and verifies a genuine Pamir current/live source.


Central Asia expansion lane — 2026-10-03:
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains a P1 unresolved live-source gap; no trustworthy scenic live camera was found yet for Khorog, Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley or the Pamir Highway.
- Adjacent high-value live-camera research was added for Shymbulak Mountain Resort (Kazakhstan), Karakol Ski Base, Ala-Archa Natural Park and Osh/Sulaiman-Too (Kyrgyzstan).
- Shymbulak and Karakol have official resort camera pages; KG Camera explicitly publishes live/no-archive cameras for Ala-Archa and Osh with a short delay.
- These adjacent cameras improve Central Asia representation but do not count as solving the Pamir gap.
- Viator/Shymbulak and Viator/Karakol future opportunities are source-gated; Pamir/Viator remains blocked until a genuine Pamir live source exists.


Central Asia large-batch checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:35 UTC:
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains an explicitly unresolved P1 source gap. Fresh English/Russian web research still found no trustworthy scenic current camera for Murghab, Khorog, Karakul Lake, Wakhan Valley or the Pamir Highway; Windfinder currently reports no nearby Murghab webcams.
- No prerecorded Pamir travel video, weather iframe or generic directory was promoted as LIVE.
- Kyrgyzstan adjacent coverage was deepened with direct, source-specific KG Camera targets for Karakol Ski Base, Ala-Archa Natural Park, Osh/Sulaiman-Too, Naryn central square, Too-Ashu Pass north entrance, Suusamyr Valley, Balykchy, Issyk-Kul/KarVen Four Seasons and Bishkek/Ala-Too Square.
- KG Camera states its feeds are unarchived surveillance with about a 20-second delay; every candidate still requires owner playback confirmation before ERN promotion.
- Viator source-gated opportunities were added for Ala-Archa/Bishkek and Issyk-Kul, based on current Viator inventory. Commercial links remain blocked until the corresponding camera/source is promoted.
- Central Asia adjacent cameras improve regional breadth but do not count as solving the Pamir/Tajikistan gap.
- Focused expansion counts and source-verification priorities were reconciled after the batch.


Mountain expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 02:45 UTC:
- Pamir research was broadened across Tajik core, Wakhan/Murghab/Karakul, Kyrgyz Alay/Osh/Batken and eastern approaches. No trustworthy core-Pamir live camera was confirmed; ERN preserves this as an explicit research gap instead of substituting prerecorded travel video.
- Added playback-gated Central Asia gateway candidates: Osh Sulaiman-Too, Batken panorama and Ala-Archa National Park.
- Added playback-gated mountain candidates outside the Pamir where live evidence is stronger: Gudauri, Kobi, Shymbulak, Everest/Hotel Everest View and Khumbu Glacier scientific camera.
- New source-gated business paths prepared: Klook Pamir Highway, Klook Ala-Archa, Klook Gudauri, Klook Shymbulak and Viator Everest/Khumbu.
- Source verification priorities and the focused expansion plan were refreshed so owner checks remain small, one-click where possible, and commercially useful only after truth verification.


Pamir / Kyrgyz approach research — 2026-10-03:
- Core Pamir remains intentionally unresolved: no trustworthy live feed found for Murghab, Karakul Lake, Wakhan, Ak-Baital or comparable core Tajik Pamir locations.
- ERN will not substitute prerecorded travel videos, GNSS monitoring stations or static tourism media for live Earth truth.
- Added research-only Kyrgyz mountain/approach candidates from kg.camera: Osh/Sulayman-Too, Batken, Razzakov, Suusamyr Valley, Ala-Archa and Karakol Ski Base.
- These broaden Central Asia coverage without falsely labeling them as Pamir proper.


Central Europe / Aegean expansion batch — 2026-10-03:
- Added research-only live candidates for Lake Bled (Slovenia), Mykonos New Port (Greece), Santorini caldera/Imerovigli (Greece), and Poiana Brașov (Romania).
- Bled and Mykonos use official tourism/municipal live pages; Poiana Brașov uses destination tourism webcam pages; Santorini uses a strong long-running provider live stream and remains link-only unless rights are explicitly established.
- Added source-gated Viator business opportunities for Bled, Mykonos, Santorini and Brașov; none can activate before the corresponding live source is human-confirmed and promoted.
- Pamir core remains intentionally unresolved; six Kyrgyz approach/mountain candidates are research-only and do not masquerade as Pamir proper.
- Source verification priority and focused expansion plan were refreshed after this batch.


Scenic-place commercial expansion — 2026-10-03:
- Added exact-link research paths for Flåm/Aurlandsfjord, Addo Elephant National Park, Chamonix/Mont Blanc, Bergen and Pico Island using the already-active Viator relationship.
- Each remains account-search / exact-link gated; no URL is invented and no public placement occurs until owner-generated tracked-link verification.
- Commercial priority matrix was refreshed so newly queued places stop appearing as generic uncovered research.


Istanbul / Bali world-gap batch — 2026-10-03:
- Added official Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality touristic-camera candidates for Sultanahmet and a Bosphorus-side view family.
- Added official Denpasar City ATCS real-time CCTV as a Bali urban live-source candidate; only a visually useful camera should be promoted.
- Added source-gated Klook + Viator business paths for Istanbul and Klook/Viator paths for Bali/Denpasar, with duplicate commercial density explicitly discouraged.
- Source verification priority and focused expansion plan refreshed.


World-gap large batch — 2026-10-03 04:20 UTC:
- Production healthy/searchable baseline remains intentionally 91; no research-only source was auto-promoted.
- Source research registry expanded with official Australian Antarctic Program webcams for Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island. AAD states station images refresh every few minutes, so any future ERN promotion must use LIVE_IMAGE/current-image semantics rather than continuous-video claims.
- Added official Panama Canal Authority camera family for Miraflores, Gatún, Pedro Miguel, Cocolí and Agua Clara Locks. ACP explicitly presents these as real-time canal web cameras.
- Added one source-gated Panama Canal/Viator commercial path to serve the whole verified lock family rather than multiplying duplicate affiliate placements.
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains unresolved by design; adjacent Central Asia cameras do not count as a Pamir solution.
- Source-verification priorities were rebuilt using human-check ease, country novelty and business unlock value without allowing commercial value to change truth state.
- Commercial priority matrix was cleaned so places already covered by verified offers or explicit opportunity paths are no longer re-researched.
- Added data/geographic-expansion-plan.json to control future regional density: underrepresented Antarctica, Central America, South America, Africa, Oceania and Caribbean are prioritized while Europe/North America expansion is deliberately restrained.
- Owner-ready batch and focused expansion plan were refreshed from the canonical registries; owner work remains dormant until autonomous research is no longer the bottleneck.


KenyaLIVE / polar / canal checkpoint — 2026-10-03:
- Public healthy/searchable production baseline remains 91; no research-only source was auto-promoted.
- Research registry now contains 101 candidates: 4 promoted and 97 human-playback-gated.
- Added official Australian Antarctic Program current-image research for Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island. AAD explicitly states station webcams refresh as still images every few minutes, so future ERN truth must be LIVE_IMAGE/current-image, not continuous-video.
- Added official Panama Canal Authority real-time camera research for Miraflores, Gatún, Pedro Miguel, Cocolí and Agua Clara Locks; one shared future Viator canal path is source-gated behind actual camera promotion.
- Added KWS KenyaLIVE / Nairobi National Park as a P1 official-government research candidate after Kenya Wildlife Service announced daily real-time wildlife broadcasts launched at Nairobi National Park on 22 September 2026. A Nairobi/Viator business path is source-gated behind park-specific live verification.
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains deliberately unresolved; ERN still refuses prerecorded or generic-camera substitutes.
- Source-verification priority, focused plan and dormant owner batch were refreshed together; autonomous research remains the active workstream.
- Commercial states now reconcile to: 12 verified-link, 23 exact-link-required, 33 source-gated, 0 live-source-gap-blocked.


Americas official-camera expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 03:50 UTC:
- Public healthy/searchable baseline remains intentionally 91; no research-only source was auto-promoted.
- Private source research registry now contains 112 candidates: 4 promoted and 108 human-playback-gated.
- Added official Costa Rica OVSICORI current-image candidates for Poás, Turrialba, Irazú and Rincón de la Vieja. OVSICORI documents automatic 5-second refresh on these camera pages, so future ERN promotion must use LIVE_IMAGE/current-image truth rather than imply continuous video.
- Added official Nicaragua INETER real-time volcano-image family for San Cristóbal, Telica, Momotombo, Masaya and Concepción. INETER states these public webcam images update every 30 seconds or 1 minute.
- Added official Ecuador IG-EPN visual-monitoring candidates for Cotopaxi and El Reventador; multiple camera angles are treated as one destination each to avoid fake place inflation.
- Commercial opportunity registry now contains 74 entries: 12 verified-link, 24 exact-link-required, 37 source-gated and 1 source-gap-blocked.
- New business paths: Poás/Klook, Rincón de la Vieja/Viator, Cotopaxi/Viator, Nicaragua volcano family/Viator, plus Marco Island/Viator from an already-healthy ERN place.
- Source verification priority, commercial matrix, geographic plan and focused expansion plan were rebuilt from the canonical registries after the batch.
- Pamir/Tajikistan remains deliberately unresolved; adjacent or unrelated mountain cameras do not count as solving that gap.


Healthy-place business expansion checkpoint — 2026-10-03 04:00 UTC:
- Business growth is no longer waiting only on future camera verification.
- Added explicit Klook exact-link queues for already-healthy Takayama, Taitung and Toyama/Tonami ERN places after confirming current Klook destination inventory.
- Commercial registry now contains 77 opportunities: 12 verified-link, 27 exact-link-required, 37 source-gated and 1 source-gap-blocked.
- Commercial priority matrix and focused plan were rebuilt so these places are not repeatedly rediscovered as uncovered opportunities.
- Existing-partner-first rule remains active; exact tracked-link generation is still owner/account-side and no URL is invented.


Commercial canonical-ID cleanup — 2026-10-03 04:10 UTC:
- Normalized older commercial opportunity records from source/camera IDs to canonical ERN place IDs wherever the active source registry provided an unambiguous mapping.
- This repaired false 'uncovered' status for verified/commercially queued places including Kyoto, Rome, Seoul, Rovaniemi and Chicago.
- Commercial priority matrix was rebuilt from canonical place IDs so future business research focuses on genuinely uncovered healthy places instead of rediscovering already-covered destinations.
- Future research-only candidate IDs remain untouched because they do not yet have canonical active-source place IDs.
- Current top genuinely-uncovered healthy-place queue begins with: koli-lake-pielinen, meads-bay-anguilla, oeschinensee, amden-walensee, new-york-harbor, lauderdale-by-the-sea, maui-hale-pau-hana, st-johns-harbour, orpen-kruger, kijihiki-plateau, waikiki-south-shore, metung-gippsland-lakes.


Verified-offer registry reconciliation — 2026-10-03 04:20 UTC:
- Commercial opportunity registry was reconciled against data/travel-offers.json so already-verified offer places no longer appear falsely uncovered.
- Synced verified coverage for Auckland Viaduct Harbour, New York Harbor, Coogee/Randwick (Sydney) and Waikiki Beach from existing verified tracked offers.
- Verified-link opportunity count is now 16; exact-link queue 27; source-gated 37; source-gap-blocked 1.
- Commercial matrix was rebuilt after synchronization, leaving only genuinely uncovered healthy places for future research.


Quasi-live searchable policy — 2026-10-03:
- Owner explicitly approved frequently refreshed webcams, updated cameras and recent provider-published pictures as valid ERN Search/Explore sources when live video is unavailable.
- Truth remains explicit: these are LIVE_IMAGE/current-monitoring or recent-image sources, never mislabeled LIVE VIDEO.
- Watch Earth remains stricter. Quasi-live additions default to featuredHold/watchHold unless separately reviewed for the featured experience.
- First autonomous quasi-live promotion batch added 9 distinct searchable places: Casey, Davis, Mawson, Macquarie Island, Poás, Turrialba, Irazú, Rincón de la Vieja and Cotopaxi.
- Healthy/searchable baseline therefore moves from 91 to 100 distinct places.
- Related business gates cleared for Poás, Rincón de la Vieja and Cotopaxi; Irazú and Turrialba Viator research was added. Exact tracked links remain owner/account-side and manually verified.
- Pamir remains deferred; no weak substitute is required now that quasi-live is an accepted future search lane.


Second quasi-live searchable batch — 2026-10-03:
- Promoted five official INETER volcano places in Nicaragua: San Cristóbal, Telica, Momotombo, Masaya and Concepción/Ometepe.
- INETER explicitly says public volcano-camera images arrive in real time every 30 seconds or 1 minute; ERN therefore labels them LIVE_IMAGE/current imagery, not live video.
- Promoted El Reventador visual monitoring from Instituto Geofísico EPN as a searchable quasi-live source.
- All six new places default to featuredHold + watchHold, keeping Watch Earth stricter than Search/Explore.
- Healthy/searchable baseline increases to 106 distinct places.
- Nicaragua/Viator commercial path moved from source-gated to exact-link research; no tracked URL is invented or activated automatically.


Central America quasi-live expansion — 2026-10-03:
- Owner explicitly approved quasi-live searchable content: refreshed webcams/current images/recent provider-published pictures are acceptable when clearly labeled; Watch Earth remains stricter and continuous-live/current.
- Added eight official-government LIVE_IMAGE searchable places without pretending they are continuous video:
  - Nicaragua / INETER: San Cristóbal, Telica, Momotombo, Masaya, Concepción/Ometepe and Cerro Negro.
  - Guatemala / INSIVUMEH: Volcán de Fuego and Santiaguito.
- INETER documents real-time/current volcano images at 30-second/1-minute network cadence, with several detail pages around five-minute refresh; INSIVUMEH states its volcano platform updates every minute.
- These sources are LINK_ONLY and searchable; they do not enter Watch Earth as live video.
- New business paths from the already-active Viator relationship: Fuego/Antigua, Cerro Negro/León and Masaya/Nicaragua. Exact tracked-link verification remains mandatory.
- Quasi-live discovery may unlock commercial planning, but commercial value cannot affect source truth, ranking or currentness.
- Healthy/searchable distinct-place baseline after this batch: 112.


Quasi-live scale-up checkpoint — 2026-10-03 04:42 UTC:
- Searchable/healthy distinct-place baseline has grown to 118; 32 more places remain to the 150-place minimum target.
- Healthy LIVE_IMAGE/quasi-live source records now total 44; Watch Earth continues to exclude quasi-live-only sources from continuous-live claims.
- Latest additions include six official GeoNet / Earth Sciences New Zealand current-image destinations: Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe, Tongariro, Taranaki Maunga, Rangitāhua/Raoul Island and Whakaari.
- Central America quasi-live additions remain eight official-government volcano places across Nicaragua and Guatemala.
- Source candidate states now reconcile to {"PROMOTED_TO_SOURCE_REGISTRY":18,"HUMAN_PLAYBACK_REQUIRED":93,"PROMOTED_TO_SEARCHABLE_QUASI_LIVE":13}.
- Commercial opportunity states now reconcile to {"VERIFIED_LINK_ADDED":16,"ACCOUNT_SEARCH_AND_EXACT_LINK_REQUIRED":37,"SOURCE_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED_BEFORE_EXACT_LINK":33,"SOURCE_GAP_MUST_BE_SOLVED_FIRST":1}.
- Klook/Tongariro is queued as a single destination-level commercial bridge across Tongariro/Ngauruhoe/Ruapehu, exact-link gated.
- Validation metadata was tightened: normalized aliases are deduplicated and all newly important quasi-live sources carry explicit representative-place coordinates with non-camera-position disclosure.
