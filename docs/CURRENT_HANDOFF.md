# Current ERN handoff

Use `docs/ERN_SOFT_LAUNCH_STAGE1_HANDOFF_2026-10-02.md` as the canonical Soft Launch continuity point and `docs/AFFILIATE_COVERAGE_EXPANSION_2026-10-02.md` as the current commercial coverage audit.

Current operating state:
- **ERN Soft Launch / Operating Stage 1**
- **OPERATE · VERIFY · MAINTAIN · DO NOT EXPAND**
- AI Search Discovery Readiness is complete and production-validated.
- Minimal first-party aggregate analytics and search-gap logging are active.
- Affiliate Coverage Expansion Batch A is complete: Kyoto/Klook, Seoul/Klook, Rome/Tiqets and Rovaniemi/Klook exact destination links are human-verified and recorded.
- Commercial ranking remains independent of commission/payout.
- Existing public feature gates remain unchanged.

Preserve completed Phases 6–10, current GitHub `main`, deployed production work, affiliate/SEO/analytics work, and all existing feature gates.

Commercial payout state:
- Travelpayouts payout method was configured and email-confirmed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- Viator payout setup was confirmed completed by the owner on 2026-10-02.
- No current payout-setup blocker remains for the active ERN affiliate relationships.

Next commercial work should be demand-led from real analytics rather than offer-count expansion. Accommodation/stay remains the largest partner-category gap, but no new account or terms should be accepted without explicit owner approval.

Older dated handoffs remain historical context only.


Production incident — 2026-10-02:
- Owner browser testing exposed Watch Earth at 0 current windows and widespread RECHECK DUE states.
- Root cause: public currentness horizons were too short for real operation (24h embeds / 72h external-live) while Operations only reported rechecks and did not mutate source evidence.
- Repaired policy: embed 168h, external-live 168h, live-image 72h, general external page 336h; embed playback proof aligned to 168h.
- Watch Earth release audit now includes the actual current clock, not only historical anchor timestamps, preventing silent deploys with zero current windows.
- A stale commercial preflight that still required Travelpayouts payout readiness to be false was also corrected after owner payout setup.
- Current-clock Operations validation after repair reported 11 Watch Earth windows, 11 places, 6 countries and 6 providers.
- Pages run 37025041354 completed SUCCESS and deployed the repair.


First-impression / discovery breadth tranche — 2026-10-02:
- Watch Earth no longer artificially caps external-current views at 12 when inside-ERN embeds are below the preferred count; it can now fill the truthful 20-window target while still preferring inside playback.
- Explore now surfaces 30 places on the initial no-query view instead of 12 and reports the broader discoverable/current place count.
- Actual-clock Watch Earth release audit now fails if production falls below 8 current windows.
- A separate ERN Live Health Watch is active and will only alert on severe current-window collapse or broken core live/search/map functionality.
- Performance ceiling remained enforced; the broader-discovery change was trimmed to stay under the app-size budget.
- Pages deployment for the broadened discovery build completed successfully.

Affiliate Expansion Batch B:
- Prepared across all four approved relationships.
- Klook: Bangkok, Singapore.
- Tiqets: Chicago, London.
- Viator: Dublin, Cape Town.
- Welcome Pickups: Bangkok, Rome.
- Exact tracked links are still owner-side evidence; no fabricated or automatic partner links are allowed.
- See `docs/AFFILIATE_EXPANSION_BATCH_B_2026-10-02.md`.
